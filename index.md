Project: What Percentage of English is used in Indian languages?

to do this project I need a good transcribe tool. I have found one recently named Veed.io. which is a video editing tool which generates subtitles. which will helo me to create the text to the movies I wanted. so that I can check what percentage of enlgish is being used in the place of telugu. 
even though there are a few tools but they are highly costly and even veed is a bit high price but managable if i be honest but let me see after some days if the prices will come down or not so that I can use for my project
